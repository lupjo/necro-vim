Introduction                                    *necro* *necro-vim*

This plugin copies the syntax file defined in
<https://gitlab.inria.fr/skeletons/necro/tools>, and
implements several commands to interact with skeletal semantics

-----
Commands                                        *necro-commands*

                                                *:NecroParse*
:NecroParse [flag]      Call necroparse on the current file.
                        When there are warnings or errors, it creates a
                        quickfix list. If the parsing and typing are
                        successful, it prints a short message, unless [flag]
                        is set to false.

                                                *:NecroML*
:NecroML [file]         Call necroml on the current file. If an argument is
                        given, then the generated file will take that name.
                        Otherwise, it tries to generate a name similar by
                        replacing the .sk extension by .ml.
                        Then the generated file is opened depending on
                        |necro_autoopen|.

                                                *:NecroCoq*
:NecroCoq [file]        Call necrocoq on the current file. If an argument is
                        given, then the generated file will take that name.
                        Otherwise, it tries to generate a name similar by
                        replacing the .sk extension by .v, and capitalizing
                        the filename. Then the generated file is opened
                        depending on |necro_autoopen|.

                                                *:NecroMLPrompt*
:NecroMLPrompt          Prompt for a filename, then call NecroML with the
                        given filename

                                                *:NecroCoqPrompt*
:NecroCoqPrompt         Prompt for a filename, then call NecroCoq with the
                        given filename

'g:necroparse_cmd'  string  (default "necroparse")
Choose what command is used to call necroparse. For instance, if you have a
local version of necro installed, you may want to >
    let g:necroparse_cmd="/path/to/local/install/necroparse"
<
                                                *g:necroml_cmd*

Mappings                                        *necro-maps*

For now, no mappings are present by default, you can always add your own.
